* Definition
** Signal
Data translated into electromagnetic information that can be transmitted and received by communications devices.

** Analog Signal
A signal that carries data in a continuous stream or waveform via either electromagnetic, or optical energy.

* Analog Signal Characteristics
+ Analog signals are time-varying electronic signals.
+ It can be either periodic and non-periodic.
+ It comsumes more power than a digital signal.
+ It is more helpful for audio/video recordings.

* Digital Data Transmission
+ Digital data utilizes voltage differences that represent the 1's and 0's.
+ Each bit takes a pre-determined period of time to transmit.
+ Bit patterns are used to establish the start and stop of the sequence and to sync clocks.
+ Sender and receiver synchronize their clocks to ensure proper receipt of data.

* Digital Data Transmission Encoding Schemes
** On-Off keying
*** NRZ- Non-Return To Zero variation
+ NRZ codes has 1 for high voltage level and 0 for low voltage level.
+ The main behavior of NRZ codes is that the voltage level remains constant during bit interval.
+ The end or start of a bit will not be indicated and it will maintain the same voltage state, if the value of the previous bit and the value of the present bit are same.

*** NRZI- Non-Return To Zero Inverted variation
+ 1 bit is indicated by making a change in the signal from the previous bit, and a 0 bit is indicated by making no change.
+ A method of mapping a binary signal to a physical signal for transmission over some transmission medium.

** Manchester Encoding
+ Commonly known as phase encoding.
+ A line code used in communication and data storage in which each data bit is encoded either high then low, or low than high for an equal period of time.

*** Overcomes downfalls of On-Off keying
*** Used over Faster Ethernet Connections

* Modulation
+ The process of converting data into radio waves by adding information to an electronic or optical carrier signal.
+ Weaker, lower frequency signals are superimposed over stronger, higher frequency signals.
+ Increase the range of transmission and decreases signal degradation.
+ *Modulation is the process of encoding information in a transmitted signal, while demodulation is the process of extracting information from the transmittion signal*.

+ *Modem* - is a device that converts data from digital computer signals to analog signals that can be sent over a phone line. This is called modulation. The analog signals are then converted back into digital data by the receiving modem. This is called demodulation.
+ *Codec* - short for "coder-decoder" is a device or software that compresses and decompresses digital data. codecs are commonly used in the field of multimedia, such as audio and video, to reduce file sizees for transmission or storage.
  - DAC - Digital to analog codec.
  - ADC - Analog to digital codec.

** Digital Modulation and Demodulation
+ Digital modulation is the translation of digital data into analog format for *transmission over long distances*.

+ As digital signals only have two states, 1 and 0, the characteristics of the analog waveform only need to be modulated in one way, such as frequency to represent the two states.

** Digital Signal Reference Methods
*** Differential 
Modulated and Demodulated signals are compared and the output then becomes the data.
[[./img/diff-dsrm.png]]

*** Single Ended
The signal is compared on one line to ground. The end result becomes the data.

** Unit Measurements of Digital Data
0 or 1 = 1 bit
2 bits = A crumb
4 bits = A nibble
8 bits = 1 byte
For a 16-bit processor a word = 16 bits
For a 32-bit processor a word = 32 bits
For a 64-bit processor a word = 64 bits
