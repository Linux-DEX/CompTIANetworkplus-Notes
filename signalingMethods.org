* Definition
** Signal
Data translated into electromagnetic information that can be transmitted and received by communications devices.

** Analog Signal
A signal that carries data in a continuous stream or waveform via either electromagnetic, or optical energy.

* Analog Signal Characteristics
+ Analog signals are time-varying electronic signals.
+ It can be either periodic and non-periodic.
+ It comsumes more power than a digital signal.
+ It is more helpful for audio/video recordings.

* Digital Data Transmission
+ Digital data utilizes voltage differences that represent the 1's and 0's.
+ Each bit takes a pre-determined period of time to transmit.
+ Bit patterns are used to establish the start and stop of the sequence and to sync clocks.
+ Sender and receiver synchronize their clocks to ensure proper receipt of data.
