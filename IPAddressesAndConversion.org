* TCP and IP
*TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)* : Connection oriented, guaranteed delivery, with reliability features that includes:
+ Flow control - for reduces overloading
+ Checksum mechanism (minor)
+ Limits maximum segment size (prevent MTU/MUT mismatch) For application that depend on reliable data delivery

*IP(Internet Protoco)* : Connectionless, best effort delivery. Outlines:
+ Information structure.
+ Navigation and route establishment.
+ Specifications to connect to the Internet.

* UDP
*UDP(User datagram protocol)* : Connectionless protocol for those applications that require expedience over reliability features:
+ Best effort delivery.
+ Stateless protocol prefers packet loss over delay in retransmitting.
+ Checksum for data integrity.
+ Addresses port numbers for functions: (DNS:53).
+ VoIP or on-line gaming.

* ARP & RARP
+ ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
+ RARP - Reverse Address Resolution Protocol

*ARP* : Request and replay protocol that:
+ Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

*ARP Process*:
1. Receives IP address from IP.
2. Looks in ARP Tables for mapping.

2a. If there:
    3. MAC returned to IP

2b. If not:
    3. Broadcast message sent.
    4. Target responds(Unicast).
    5. MAC Added to table.
    6. MAC returned to IP.
 
RARP Maps MAC addresses to IP addresses.

* ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
+ Attempts to report on system status.
+ Used for diagnostic and testing purposes.
+ Utilities from ICMP: Tracert, Pathping, Ping.
+ Internet Layer Protocol.
+ Ping uses ICMP echo requests.

* IGMP - Internet Group Management Protocol
+ Used to establish memberships for multicast groups.
