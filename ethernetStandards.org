[[./img/ethernet.png]]

* History of Ethernet
+ Ethernet was invented by Bob Metcalfe in 1973.
+ A remarkable computing environment of that time because of the following:
    - Computing was dominated by large and very expensive mainframe computer.
    - Only a few people could afford to buy mainframe computers.
    - Only a few people knew how to use them.
+ Bob Metcalfe changed the name of his first experimental network from  Alto Aloha Network to Ethernet.

* Why the name "Ethernet"?
+ In Bob Metcalfe experimental network, the physical medium or the cable carried bits to all the computers.
+ To describe this important feature Bob Metcalfe named the network based on the word "Ether":
    - The old "luminiferous aether" was once considered the medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

* Introduction to Ethernet Standards
+ Ethernet was first standardized by the consortium of DEC, Intel and Xerox or DIX.
    - It was later standardized by the IEEE.
+ The standards define several aspects that make data transmission possible on the network.
+ The term Ethernet is used to refer both the original DIX Ethernet standard and the IEEE 802.3 specifications.

* IEEE Standard 802.3
+ IEEE standard 802.3 is an international standard for LANs and MANs that employ the following.
    - CSMA/CD as the shared media access method.
    - Ethernet protocol and frame format for data communication.

* What is IEEE
IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
    - Largest professional association for the advancement of technology.
    - Has more than 426,000 members in more than 160 countries.

* What IEEE does
+ IEEE provides the following:
    - Highly cited publications.
    - Develops technology standards.
    - Holds conferences to advance technological innovation and excellence.

* IEEE's Portfolio
+ IEEE is a leading developer of international standards.
+ IEEE's portfolio of standards include the prominent IEEE 802 standards for the following:
    - Local network.
    - Metropolitan network.
    - Other area networks, including Ethernet and Wireless LAN.

* Ethernet Medium
+ The early Ethernet ran over coaxial cables.
+ The modern Ethernet networks use a mixture of copper and fiber-optic cabling.

* Baseband and Broadband
The term "band" refers to a range of frequencies, and the term "bandwidth", in the context of signal transmission, refers to the width of a band of frequencies.

** Broadband
+ In a broadband system, the whole band of the transmission medium is shared by dividing it into pieces, called channels:
    - Each channel will have the portion of the whole band.
    - Multiple channels will serve as multiple signal carriers, each carraying its own data on the same transmission medium.

** Baseband
+ In a baseband system, the entire band of the transmission medium will be used as a signal carrier.

* Ethernet Naming Covention
Ethernet standards use a naming convention that helps us determine the following:
    + The transmission speed.
    + Signaling type.
    + Cable length.
    + Cable type used.

** Naming Convention Examples
+ For example, 10BASE5 is named for the following:
    - 10 means that transmission speed is 10 Mbps.
    - Base means the signaling type is baseband.
    - 5 at the end indicates that the maximum length of a cable segment can be 500 meters.

+ Similarly, for 10BASE-TX, the following is true:
    - 100 indicates a transmission speed of 100 Mbps.
    - Base means the signaling type is baseband.
    - T indicates that the standard is meant twisted-pair cabling.
    - X at the end indicates that the cable is capable of full duplex communication.

* 10BASE5 
+ The 10BASE5 is a physical layer specification of IEEE 802.3 that identifies the original Ethernet or the DIX Ethernet.
+ This Ethernet network used a thick coaxial cable as its physical medium.
+ Was referred to thicknet.

* Thicknet
+ Thicknet ran at 10 Mbps
+ The type of thick coaxial cable used was as follows:
    1. Either RG-8 or RG-11 with 50 ohm resistance.
    2. The RG label stands for "Radio Government"
        - Determines the type of coaxial cables.
+ The distance limitation of a cable segment was 500 meters.

* Thinnet
+ Thinnet is based on the 10BASE2 specification of IEEE 802.3 standard.
+ Thinnet ran at 10 Mbps.
+ The type of thin coaxial cable used was as follows:
    - RG-58 with 50 ohm resistance.
    - Signaling type used is baseband.
+ The distance limitation of a cable segment is 185 meters.
    - represented by "2" in 10BASE-2
+ Being cheaper than thicknet, it was called "Cheapernet"

* 10BASE-T
+ 10BASE-T standard was introduced in 1990.
+ 10BASE-T is a physical layer specification of IEEE 802.3 standard for Ethernet network:
    1. Ran at 10 Mbps over two pairs of twisted-pair telephone wire.
    2. Allowed networks to use the existing telephone cabling:
        - Easy installations and reduced cost.
+ The "T" in 10BASE-T denotes twisted-pair wires.
+ Twisted pair cable for 10BASE-T is category 3 (Cat 3) cable.
+ Higher category cables can also be used with the 10BASE-T Ethernet:
    - Example: Cat 5, Cat 5e, Cat 6, and Cat6a
    - Higher categories of UTP cables have higher specifications.
    - Can handle higher data transmission speeds.
+ 10BASE-T supports maximum cable length of 100 meters.

* 100BASE-TX
+ 100BASE-TX is the physical layer specification of IEEE 802.3 standard for Ethernet network:
    - Runs at 100 Mbps over two pairs of Category 5 twisted-pair cabling
+ The maximum length of the cable segment is 100 meters.
+ 100BASE-TX is called as Fast Ethernet:
    - Operates at 100 Mbps.
    - Faster than 10BASE-T

** Popularity of 100BASE-TX
+ Because widely used because of it compatibility with the 10BASE-T standard
    - 10BASE-T Ethernet networks utilized Category 5 cables.
    - A lot easier to upgrade the existing network to operate at 100 Mbps by making a few changes.

* 100BASE-FX
+ Modern Ethernet networks also use fiber-optic cabling.
+ The fiber standard for 100 Mbps Ethernet network is 100BASE-FX.
+ 100BASE-FX is an IEEE 802.3u specification:
    1. 100 Mbps Ethernet network over two multimode optical fibers.
    2. Two multimode optical fibers:
        - One is used for the transmitter.
        - The other is used for the receiver.
+ 100BASE-FX supports a maximum cable length of the following:
    - 400 meters in half-duplex mode.
    - 2 kilometers in full-duplex mode.
+ Half-duplex mode:
    - A device can either send or receive data at a given time but not both
+ Full-duplex mode:
    - A device can send and receive data at the same time.

+ Easy to install:
    - Designed to run on Cat 5 UTP cables.
    - Cat 5 UTP cables are inexpensive and commonly available.

* Cat 5 cables
+ Cat 5 cables have four pairs of twisted pair wires.
+ 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T Ethernet uses only two pairs of Cat 5.
+ 1000BASE-T uses all the four pair of Cat 5.
