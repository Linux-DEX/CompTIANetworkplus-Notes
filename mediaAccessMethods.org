* Media Access
+ Rules that govern what node has access to transmit on the media at any given time.
+ All nodes on the network will be configured to follow these rules.
+ These rules ensure data delivery and data integrity is maintained.

* Contention-based Media Access
+ Nodes compete with one another for media access time and utilization.
+ Also called competitive, or collision based.
+ Easy to implement and maintain, however data exchange can be delayed for nodes competing.
+ Example of contention-based access methods includes: CSMA/CD for bus-topology Ethernet LANs and CSMA/CA for WLANs.
  
** Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection( CSMA-CD )
+ Contention based media access method with a 5 step process used in Ethernet LANs.
+ Attempts to provide collision free data transfer communications.
+ Nodes transmit when they have data to send.
+ When collisions occur, they be detected and managed.
  
*** CSMA-CD works
+ *Step 1* : Check if the sender is ready for transmitting data packets.
+ *Step 2* : Check if the transmission link is idle.
+ *Step 3* : Transmit the data & check for collisions.
+ *Step 4* : If no collision was detected in propagation, the sender completes its frame transmission and resets the counters.

*Note*: In wireless it doesn't work very well. It is good in wire connection.

** Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance( CSMA-CA )
+ Contention Based media access method with a Six step process primarily used in wireless LANs.
+ Attempts to provide collision free communications.
+ Nodes transmit when they have data to send, but take steps before transmitting to avoid collisions.

*** CSMA-CA
+ *Step 1* : When a frame is ready, the transmitting station checks whether the channel is idle or busy.
+ *Step 2* : If the channel is busy, the station waits until the channel becomes idle.
+ *Step 3* : If the channel is idle, the station waits for an Inter-frame gap(IFG) amount of time and then send the frame.
+ *Step 4* : After sending the frame, it sets a timer.
+ *Step 5* : The station then waits for acknowledgement from the receiver. If it receives the acknowledgement before expiry of timer, it marks a successful transmission.
+ *Step 6* : Otherwise, it waits for a back-off time period and restarts the algorithm.

*** Contention Domain
+ Also called a Collision Domain.
+ Nodes on the network compete for access, and collision occur as a result.
+ _Switches_ control the size of the contention domain.
+ Larger networks are divided into smaller contention domains to improve performance.
  
*** Broadcast Domain
+ Logical area of a network where all nodes can communicate with all other nodes.
+ _Routers_ control the size of the Broadcast domain.
+ Refers to the set of devices that receive broadcasted data transmissions from any node on the segment.

* Controlled Media Access  
+ Also called deterministic media access, has a device controls which nodes have access to the network media, and for how long.
+ More difficult to implement and maintain as extra hardware and maintenance is needed.
+ Ensures device that have time sensitive data can transmit when needed, so are beneficial to time sensitive networks.

** Multiplexing
Media Access method that takes multiple signals and combines them over a single medium.

*** Can be multiplexed using TDM - Time Division Multiplexing
+ Channel divided into time slots.
+ Each node assigned a time slot.
+ Multiple =Baseband= channels can be combined.

*** Or using FDM - Frequency Division Multiplexing
+ Data from multiple nodes is sent over many frequencies.
+ Each node has complete access to its frequency and dedicated communication with the mux.
+ The mux combines the received signals from the nodes and transmits it across the medium.
+ Multiple =Broadband= signal can be combined.

*** Both TDM & FDM rely on the central device called a multiplexer
A *Mux* or *Multiplexer*, is the device that combines signals and transmits them to the receiving end where a *De-Mux*, or *De-multiplexer* separates the signals.

* Polling
+ A central deivce goes to each node in the network in turn to see whether the node has data to transmit.
+ Guaranted access as the process is repeated constantly.
+ Not effective in time sensitive networks as time is potentially wasted in requesting from nodes that do not have data.
+ A variation of polling is *Demand Priority*.
+ Each node signals its state of whether it has data to transmit or not.
+ Contains priority measures and also safeguards to ensure nodes cannot constantly transmit.
