* Interoperability Services
+ Just as TCP/IP contains various protocols, it also contains Interoperability Services.
  [[./img/pc-mac.png]]
+ These Services allow for computers to share resources securely and efficiently, even when they are completely different from one another.

* NFS: Network File System
+ Application that allows users to access remote network files and resources.
+ Used for systems that are dissimilar, such as Unix and Microsoft Systems.
+ Functions independently of the Operating system, network architecture, or computer system it is installed on.
+ Listens on port 2049 by default.

* SSH: Secure Shell
+ A very secure method to access a computer and resources remotely.
+ Creates a secure session, or shell with the remote machine by using authentication mechanisms.
+ Works with many systems including Unix, Microsoft, Linux, and Macintosh.
+ Port 22 by default.

* SCP: Secure Copy
+ A secure method of copying files from one device to another remotely.
+ Works with many systems including Unix, Microsoft, Linux, and Macintosh.
+ Also uses port 22 by default.
  
* Telnet
+ Terminal emulation protocol that allows users at one site to simulate a session on a remote machine.
+ uses port 23 by default.

* SMB: Server Message Block
+ Also known as CIFS or common Internet File system.
+ Used for providing communications to nodes on a network, access to files and peripheral devices and ports.
+ Most well known for accessing file systems or printers on shared networks or from the server.
+ Port 445 by default.

* LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
+ Main purpose is for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services, in an IP network.
+ Used for managing directory information and tasking in networks that contain user, object or other kinds of directories.
+ "Lightweight" because it is not as network intensive as its predecessor DAP.
+ Port 389 by default
+ relies heavily on DNS.
+ microsoft and active directory sevice, NDS and apple open directory all use LDAP.

* Zeroconf
A set of technologies allowing network devices on a local network(such as home or small office) to *automatically configure themselves*.
+ It generally uses *MAC address*.

+ Four function for zeroconf
    - Network address assignment must be automatic.
    - Automatic multicast address assignment.
    - Automatic translation between network names and addresses.
    - Discovery of network services, or the location, by the protocol and the name is required.
