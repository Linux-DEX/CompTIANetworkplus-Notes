* Port
+ A port is an process-specific or application-specific designation, serving as a communications endpoint in a computer's operating system.
+ Identifies Processes and Applications and the allowed communication paths they take in a network.
+ Ports range from 1 to 65,535. Port 0 is reserved and cannot be used.

** Port Ranges
+ *Well Known Ports*- Range: 1-1023 | used by well-known, common services.
+ *Registered Ports*- Range: 1024-49,151 | Reserved by Applications and programs.
+ *Dynamic/Private Ports*- Range: 49,152- 65,535 | used by unregistered services and temporary connections.
  
* Well Known Default Ports

* File Transfer Protocol
+ FTP is a communications protocols used for transferring or exchanging files between two computers. 
+ These transferring of files generally is authenticated by username and password credentials.

+ *TFTP* (Trivial File transfer protocol)
    - Simple version of FTP that does not support error correction.
    - TFTP is a simple high-level protocol for transferring data servers use to boot diskless workstations, X-terminals, routers by using User Data Protocol(UDP)
+ Cmd prompt command to use FTP ftp (FQDN) (IP address of remote host)
+ FTP used port 20 or 21 by default.

NOTE: FQDN - fully qualified domain name  

* SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
+ Used for *Outgoing* email.
+ Used over unreliable WAN links.
+ Default Port: 25 sometimes it use Port: 587
  

* POP-3: Post Office Protocol
+ The most commonly used protocol for receiving email over the internet.
+ is used to receive emails from the remote server and send to a local client.
+ After the client receive the emails it will delete it from the server.
+ Default Port: 110
  
NOTE:
    - SMTP is a TCP/IP protocol used in sending and receiving e-mail.
    - It is typically used with POP3 or internet Message access protocol to *save message in a server mailbox* and download them periodically from the server for the user.

* IMAP/4: Internet Message Access Protocol
+ Used for *Incoming email*.
+ More powerful than POP 3.
+ Easier mailbox management, more search capabilities, and allows partial downloading of multimedia files, saving bandwidth.
+ Default Port: 143
  
[[./img/IMAP.png]]
  
+ allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail message on a server.
+ IMAP doesn't download the email files from the server to the local device.
+ IMAP you can view the same email on multiple local devices.

* NTP: Network Time Protocol
+ NTP is a protocol that allows the synchronization of system clocks (from desktops to servers).
+ NTP Master clock server.
+ Accurate up to the millisecond.
+ Default Port: 123

* NNTP: Network News Transfer Protocol
+ Protocol for posting and retrieving of bulletin messages from USENET.
+ Transporting usenet news articles (netnews) between news servers, and for reading/posting articles by the end user client applications.
+ RSS feeds are based on NNTP.
+ default Port: 119

* HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
+ also called stateless protocol
+ Used for connecting with web servers and viewing and interacting with web pages.
+ For users to dynamically interact with web pages, add-ons may be needed as well.
+ Default Port: 80
    - Common Alternative port: 8080
+ allows data to be transferred using the World Wide Web

* HTTPS: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over SSL
+ Secure version of HTTP
+ Uses SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data.
+ Preferred over HTTP and available on most web pages.
+ default port: 443
  
* RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol
+ Built into Microsoft Operating systems by default.
+ Allows users to remotely access data and network resources from another physical location.
+ Default port: 3389
