* OSI
+ A conceptual model created by the international Organization for standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols.
+ The purpose of the OSI reference model is to guide technology vendors and developers so the digital communications products and software programs they create can interoperate and to promote a clear framework that describes the functions of a networking or telecommunications system that's in use.
