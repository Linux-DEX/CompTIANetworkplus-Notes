* Network Fundamentals
** Network:
An interconnected or interrelated chain, group, or system.

** Computer Network:
Two or more computers that are connected with one another for the purpose of /communicating/ data electronically.

** Components Of A Network
+ *Devices* : this are the actual computer for example: computer, printer, router, switches etc...
+ *Media* : Media can be physical connection such as copper, fiber optics, Or it can be wireless for example wifi.
+ *Adapter* : Every device communicate differently with each other, to allow this device to communicate with each other we use network adapter. It serve as translater between the commponent or device over the media which the data is send.
+ *Network operating system* : To manage and govern it need a OS, it tell the network how to work together as efficiently as possible over the  media, over the adapter, without the OS there will not be any order and direction in the network.

** Node
+ Any device that is connected to a communications network.
+ This also called as *end point nodes*, because that where the data end.
+ *Router, switch, hub* are called as =Redistribution= nodes.

** Server
+ It is a network device which is responsible for sharing resource and managing the certain services. like address(ip address).
+ Manages devices on the network and controls network wide functions like =permissions=.
+ A piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called *clients*.

** The Network Backbone

[[./img/networkbackbone.png]]

+ The network backbone is responsible for carrying the *Majority of Network traffic*.
+ It work on very high speed.
+ It basically connect all the smaller network together.

*** Types of Network Backbones:

+ *Serial* : One backbone cable, multiple switches connected.
+ *Hierarchical/Distributed* : Easy management, typical for LAN, easily scalable.
+ *Collapsed* : Uses a Router as the connecting point.
+ *Parallel* : Like collapsed, but uses multiple cable connections. Great for redundancy.

** Terminal 
+ Terminal is network hardware device that is used to entering the data into it and displaying the data from computer computing system.
+ It is called dummy computer because it does not have any processing capability of its own. this does not have any memory.
+ It need terminal emulator to emulate what id going on the server.

** Client
+ A computer hardware or software device that requests access to service provided by a server as part of the client-server model of computer networks.
+ It has it own processer, and memory.

** Peer
+ Provides Its own Resources and services.
+ It is Self managed and self contained.
+ It can act as both server & client.
  
* Categories of Networks

** LAN - Local Area Network
+ Spans the geographical area of a small building, or a floor of a larger building.
+ Most commonly implemented technology is Ethernet, however it is not limited to only Ethernet technologies.
+ The Nodes in a LAN are directly connected to one another by cable or short range wireless.
+ LAN operates at a relatively higher speed compared to other WAN systems.

+ Connects multiple local area networks together.
+ Utilizes long range communications such as satellite, or radio frequency.
+ Can be private, such as an international corporation, or Public. The worlds largest public WAN is the Internet.

[[./img/wan.png]]

*** Types of WANs:

**** PAN - Personal Area Network
+ PAN is a computer network for interconnecting electronic devices within an individual person's workspace.
+ It provides data transmission among devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets and personal digital assistants.

**** CAN - Campus Area Network
+ A computer network made up of multiple internconnected local area network(LANs) within a limited geographical area.
+ It is smaller than a WAN and MAN.
+ It is used in manufacturing, warehousing, universities, and also in corporate and industrial settings.

**** MAN - metropolitan Area Network
+ MAN is a high speed network that spans a larger geographic area than a local area network(LAN) but smaller than a wide area network(WAN).
+ MAN is formed by connecting multiple LANs.
+ providing the ability to integrate multiple services through the transmission of data, voice, and video.

**** GAN - Global Area Network
+ GAN refers to a network composed of different interconnected computer network(WANs) that cover an unlimited geographical area.
+ It is loosely synonymous with the internet.

*** EN - Enterprise Network
An EN is a network that typically is comprised of components of both a WAN and a LAN and is owned and operated by a single organization or company.

*** WAN Administrator Duties:
+ Specialized in their respective fields.
+ Network oriented tasks, rather user oriented tasks.
+ Developing and programming scripts for network task automation.
+ Testing and implementing software and hardware upgrades, network wide.

** Internet
+ The internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the internet protocal suits(TCP/IP) to communicate between networks & devices.

** Intranet
+ An intranet is a private network contained within an enterprise that is used to securely share company information and computing resources among empolyees.
+ Keeps your network private, or secure from outside sources.
+ Save services & protocals as the internet.

** Extranet
+ An extranet is a controlled private network that allows access to partners vendors & suppliers or an authorized set of customers.
+ A portion of your network that is opened to limited outside sources.
+ Helps adminstrators maintain security to the rest of your network.
+ Allows individuals like vendors to have minimal access.
+ An extension of an entity intranet.

** Segment
+ A portion of a network with linked devices separated by a connectivity device such as a switch.

** Network Model
The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships.

*** Centralized

[[./img/centralized.png]]

+ A type of network where all users connect to an central server.
+ The host computer is called *Mainframe* and the end nodes are called as *terminals*.
  
**** Problem
+ It is difficult to maintain.
+ If the connection to mainframe is losses the whole network is down.

*** Client/Server

+ server is responsible for providing services like file sharing, authenitication, etc..
+ The process and resource can be allocated where ever they needed including on the client.
+ The end node can perform there own process and end user task without constantly talk over the server.
  
[[./img/client-server.png]]

* Network Topologies
** Topology
+ Describes the arrangement or layout of a communications networks.
+ Lines out the path data communication will take.
+ Allows administrators to understand how the devices are connected on the network.
+ Two types of topologies: Physical and logical.
  
*** Physical Topology
+ How the devices are actually connected to one another.
+ Describes the *Shape* the network takes.
+ Allows the administrator to understand how the physical media, or cable, connects the devices together.

*** Logical Topology
+ Descibes pathway data will take, regardless of the physical connection.
+ Allows an administrator to troubleshoot problems with communication in transit by understanding the path data is taking.
+ Possibly could be very different than the physical topology of the network.
  
** Network Connections
*** Point To Point Connections
+ A direct connection between two nodes on a network.
+ example like telephone call, in which on telephone is connected with one other.

*** Multiple Connections
+ Nodes on a network are connected to two or more nodes simultaneously. 
+ Signals are not private in Multipoint connections.

*** Radiated Connections
+ A wireless connection that is either Point To Point, or Multipoint. 
+ Also considered a Broadcast connection.
  
NOTE: 
+ *Unicast* - Unicast is data transmission from a single sender to a single receiver. Other device on the network do not participate in the communication.
+ *Multicast* - Multicast is group communication where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously.
+ *Broadcast* - Method of transferring a message to all recipients simultaneously.

** Physical Bus Topology
+ Bus topology is multipoint connection.
+ The signal is bounce back from the end, when the signal bounces it interupt the transmission if there is nothing to stop it from bouncing.
+ show we have terminator at the end which is =50ohm= so it prevent the signal form bouncing.
+ The nodes are connected with the help of T connector.

[[./img/physicalbustopology.png]]

** Physical Star Topology
+ A type of LAN topology in which all nodes, including computers, servers, & printers, are directly connected to a contral node, also known as a hub or switch.
+ switch will determine where the data is going.
+ hub will send the data to everyone.

[[./img/physicalStarTopology.png]]

** Physical Ring Topology
+ Each node is connected to it =Upstream= & =Downstream= neighbors only.
+ The data flow in single direction or *Unidirectional*. so there is now collision is going to happen.
+ Because the data is recieved and retransmitted from node to node the transmittion should be strong and clear.
+ If one connection is lossed the whole network will be down, because it is unidirectional. 

[[./img/physicalRingTopology.png]]

** Physical Tree Topology
+ It has a root node and all other nodes are connected to it forming a hierarchy. It is also called hierarchical topology.
+ It should at least have three levels to the hierarchy.
+ first node is root node, next second level nodes, then third level nodes.
+ It is scalable in nature.

[[./img/physicaltreeTopology.png]]

** Physical Mesh Topology
+ All the computer are inter-connected to each other.
+ Highly reliable and efficient.
+ Expensive and difficult to implement.

*** T568/A Wiring Standards
[[./img/T568-A.png]]

*** T568/B wiring Standards
[[./img/T568-B.png]]

** STP and UTP Cable:
*** Shielded Twisted Pair Cabling
+ Twisted Pair copper cabling that has a metal foil, or braided shielding surrounding the pairs.
+ Decreases the susceptibility of EMI.
+ More expensive that UTP and can be more difficult to work with.

*** Unshielded Twisted Pair Cabling
+ Unlike STP, UTP cabling does not have any protective metal coating.
+ Very susceptible to EMI.
+ Relatively inexpensive and very easy to work with.

* Straight-through, crossover, and Rollover cables
** Modular Connector
+ The electrical connector that is commonly used in the following:
    - Telephone systems
    - Data networks
    - Low-speed serial connections
+ Known by the following names:
    - RJ connector
    - Modular phone jack/plug
    - Western jack/plug
+ The male modular connector is called a plug.
+ Used to terminate loose end of cables.
+ The female modular connector is called a jack or a socket.
+ Used to fixed locations, such as on equipment.
+ Modular connector example: 8 position 8 contact(8P8C) connector.

[[./img/ethernet.png]]

** 8 Position 8 Contact(8P8C) connector
An 8P8C connector used in an Ethernet computer network that uses twisted pair cables in the following:
+ Commonly referred to as RJ-45
+ Resembles an actual RJ-11 connector used on telephone cables.
+ Has nothing to do with the actual RJ-45 standard.

** T568A & T568B wiring schemes
The TIA/EIA-568-B standard specifies the following:
+ A 4-pair 100 ohms UTP cable be terminated in an eight-position modular jack(an 8P8C modular connector)
+ Provides two wiring schemes: T568A and T568B
+ Defines the pinout or order of connections for wires in 8P8C modular connector plugs and jacks.

In order to terminate an UTP cable with an 8P8C modular connector, we should know the following:
+ Which wire of the cable connects to which pin of the connector
+ T568A and T568B wiring standards
    - Govern the assignments of wires to the pins of an 8P8C connector.

[[./img/UTPcable.png]]

+ On the back of an 8P8C connector, there are 8 pins numbered from 1 to 8.
+ The difference between T568A and T568B wiring scheme is that there is an interchange of green and orange wire pairs.

[[./img/pinpair.png]]

+ The TIA/EIA-568-B standard recommends using T568A pinout for horizontal cables.
+ The T568B pinout became widely used because of the following:
    - Matched the older AT&T 258A pinout
    - The AT&T 258A pinout was widely used in the UTP cabling infrastructure at the time TIA/EIA-568 was published.

** Horizontal Cabling
Horizontal cabling wiring can be IW(inside wiring) or plenum cabling and connects telecommunications rooms to individual outlets or work areas on the floor, usually through the wireways, conduits or ceiling spaces of each floor. A horizontal cross-connect is where the horizontal cabling connects to a patch panel or punch up block, which is connected by backbone cabling to the main distribution facility.

[[./img/horizontalcable.png]]

** MDI
+ Stands for medium dependent interface.
+ A hardware interface that establisheds a direct physical and electrical connection with an UTP cable.
+ An MDI port is the traditional port on the back of a computer's NIC.
+ An MDI device is a device with an MDI port
    - example: A computer or a laptop

** MDI-X
+ Stands for Media Dependent Interface with Crossover.
+ MDI-X is a crossover of the Medium Dependent Interface.
+ The Ports of devices that provides connectivitiy, such as a switch or a hub, are setup as Media Dependent Interface with Crossover(MDI-X)
+ An MDI-X device is a device with an MDI-X port
    - example: A switch or a router

[[./img/MDI_MDI-X.png]]

+ The transmit and receive connections of an MDI port and an MDI-X port are opposite each other.
+ When an MDI device uses a Pair of wires to transmit signals, the MDI-X device on the opposite side uses the same pair to receive the signals, and vice versa
+ The arrangement of twisted pair wires allows the signals to be transmitted and received in an UTP cable.


+ The transmit and receive connections of an MDI port and an MDI-X port are opposite each other.
+ When an MDI device uses a Pair of wires to transmit signals, the MDI-X device on the opposite side uses the same pair to receive the signals, and vice versa
+ The arrangement of twisted pair wires allows the signals to be transmitted and received in an UTP cable.

** Straight-through cable
+ A type of Ethernet cable used to connect dissimilar devices
    - example: An UTP cable connecting a computer and a switch.
+ Also known as a patch cable.
+ UTP cables are used in modern Ethernet networks.
+ The wires of an UTP cable cannot be plugged directly into the following:
    - A computer's NIC.
    - A switch's port

[[./img/straight-through-cable.png]]

*** Wiring standards for RJ-45
+ Wiring standards for an RJ-45 connector are as follows:
    - EIA/TIA 568A
    - EIA/TIA 568B
+ Specifies how to wire an RJ-45 connector on an Ethernet network.

*** Straight-through cable - Termination
+ Only one of the following standards are used for terminating the ends of an UTP cable in RJ-45 connectors:
    - T568A
    - T568B

[[./img/termination.png]]

+ Straight-through cables are used when connecting an MDI device to an MDI-X device.
[[./img/stcable.png]]

+ If a straight-through UTP cable is terminated on both sides using the T568A wiring scheme, then the T568A color scheme and the pinout or the order of connections of all 8 wires will be as shown in the diagram.
[[./img/T568A.png]]

** Ethernet Network -- 10Base-T and 100Base-TX
+ When a computer uses pins 1 and 2 of a pair of wire to transmit data, the switch will receive those data on the same pins.
+ When a switch transmits the data using pins 3 and 6 on a different pair of wires, the computer will receive those data on the same pins.
+ In an Ethernet network, such as 10Base-T and 100Base-TX, pins 4 and 5 of the blue pair, and pins 7 and 8 of the brown pair are not used.
+ In a 1000Base-T Ethernet cable, such as Cat 5e UTP cable, all four pairs of wires will be used.

[[./img/ethernetNetwork.png]]

** Crossover Cable
+ Used to connect the following:
    - An MDI device to an MDI device.
    - An MDI-X device to an MDI-X device.
+ Connects similar devices.
    - example: A switch and a switch

+ A crossover UTP cable has 8-pin modular connectors on each end that are terminated in such a manner that the pin and wire assignments are crossed over at the ends.
+ Each pin and wire on one end of the cable doesn't connect to the exact same pin on the other end of the cable.

[[./img/UTPcrossovercable.png]]

+ When we connect two similar devices, such as a switch and a switch, using an UTP cable, the crossover of pins becomes necessary because of the following:
    - These devices will be transmitting on the same pins, 1 and 2.
    - These devices will also be receiving on the same pins, 3 and 6.

** Crossover cable - Termination
+ The end of a crossover cable are terminated in 8-pin modular plugs by using the T568A wiring and the T568B standard.
+ If one end of the cable uses T568A standard for wire and pin assignment in its 8-pin modular plug, then the other end should use the T568B standard in its 8-pin modular jack.

+ Most modern Ethernet devices support the Auto-MDI-X feature.

** Rollover Cable
+ Used to connect a PC or a laptop directly to the console port of a switch or a router.
+ Has an 8P8C connector on one end and a RS-232 based connector, such as DB-9 connector, on the other end.
