* Data Transmission
+ The exchange of data between devices on a network by one method or another.
+ Involves non-voice transmission such as text, video, graphics and audio over a network medium, unlike telephony, which is only voice.
+ Type typical transmission across a computer network, also is synonymous with a data network.

* Instantaneous Data Transfer
+ Data is not stored in memory before it is transmitted.
+ Examples of Instantaneous Data Transfer: Online chat programs, video conferencing, or voice conferencing via an internet program.
+ Data is immediately converted to a network compatible format as it is being generated and transmitted.

* Serial Data Transmission
+ The transmission of bits occurs once per clock cycle.
+ 1 bytes = 8 serial bits.
+ Ethernet, as well as peripheral devices like mice and keyboards use Serial Data Transmission.
+ May use *Synchronous*, or *Asynchronous* methods to delineate between the start bits, stop, bits, error checking/correcting bits, and the data itself.

** Synchronous Data Transmission
+ The term synchronous is used to describe *a continuous and consistent timed transfer of data blocks*.
+ Uses time intervals and must be in sync.
+ These types of connections are used when large amount of data must be transferred very quickly from one location to the other.

** Asynchronous Data Transmission
+ Asynchronous transmission, sometimes referred to as start/stop transmission.
+ involves sending data to the receiver using the flow control method.
+ Special start and stop patterns between each byte of data.
+ Data is synchronized between the sender and the receiver without the use of a clock. 
+ Data is transmitted one character or 8 bits at a time.

* Parallel Data Transmission
+ Uses multiple transmissions lines, wires, or cables simultaneously.
+ 1 character is 8 parallel bits.
+ Example, SCSI, Parallel ports, and PC Cards Bus uses Parallel Data Transmission.

* Baseband Transmission
+ Transmits _digital signal_ without changing it to _analog signal_.
+ Requires a channel having a bandwidth that starts at 0.
+ Digital signals sent via DC(Direct current) pulses.
+ All devices share the medium or channel and cannot transmit and receive simultaneously.
+ Multiple Baseband channels can be combined over I medium using a channel with specific time slots.

* Broadband Transmission
+ Changes _digital signal_ into _analog signal_ for transmission.
+ Uses a channel with bandwidth not starting at 0.
+ Uses Analog signaling over the complete bandwidth available.
+ Signals travel in one direction only as devices connot send and receive over the same channel.
+ More than one Broadband channel can be combined and sent across multiple frequencies, channels or over just one medium.

* Broadband over Power Lines
+ BPL is an emerging technology that attempts to bring High Speed internet to homes through power lines.
+ Uses the electrical infrastructure already in place.
+ Can reach speeds from 500kbps to 3Mbps, or around DSL and cable speeds.
